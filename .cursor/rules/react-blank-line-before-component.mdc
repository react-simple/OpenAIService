# Blank line before component definition

In React (TSX), add a **blank line before** each component definition.

**Pattern:** `export const ComponentName = () => {` or `export const ComponentName = (props) => {`

**Example:**
```tsx
import { Something } from "./Something";

export const Home = () => {
  // ...
};
```

Do not place the component definition immediately after the last import without a blank line.
