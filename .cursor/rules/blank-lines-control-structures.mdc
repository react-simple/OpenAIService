description: Blank lines before and after if, for, while, switch
alwaysApply: true

# Blank lines around control structures

Keep a **blank line before** and **after** every `if`, `for`, `while`, and `switch` structure.

**Exceptions:**
- If the structure is the **first** statement in its parent block, do **not** add a blank line before it.
- If the structure is the **last** statement in its parent block, do **not** add a blank line after it.

Apply in both backend (C#) and frontend (TypeScript/TSX).

**Example (C#):**
```csharp
var a = 1;

if (condition)
{
  DoSomething();
}

var b = 2;
```

**Example (TS):**
```ts
const list = [];

for (const x of items)
{
  list.push(x);
}

return list;
```
